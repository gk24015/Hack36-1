Codenate is a platform that connects developers having common interest and enables them to come together , code and collaborate for the real world problems. Developers can choose project that matches their skills and tech requirements from various available projects and can also share their ideas to get collaborators.

Since the pandemic has brought out the importance of work from  home ,putting a hold to physical meet ups so our team came up with the idea of Codenate where developers can easily find , interact virtually and contribute to the project of their choice.
